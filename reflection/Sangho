My tasks were making upcoming appointment list, handling basic UIs (tab menus, header, transition buttons), treating Google Map API, making several input groups (memo, meeting point), and making reward popup.

We used "React" library of javascript, and because it was my first time to develop a web service, it was a little difficult to study html, javascript, and css. Most of my tasks are related to UI, so aligning elements to appropriate positions was harder than I thought. To do this, rather than starting with my own design from scratch, just looking for a socially acceptable design on the Internet helped me to design. Also, since 4 people were programming an app at the same time, there were several conflicts on implementation. However, we effectively solved through communication between team members.

It was good to learn the important functions of react, although not tremendous skills. For example, I learned how to transit to other screen when a button is pressed, how to take an Google Map API key to display a map and set a marker at a desired point, or how to receive user input from an input group and print it on the screen. Now I can handle features that can be used as important in social apps.
